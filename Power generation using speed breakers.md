# Power generation using speed breakers 
## Problem Statement :
A large amount of electricity is wasted at the speed breakers through friction , everytime a vehicle passes through it. So electricity can be generated using vehicle weight (Potential energy) as input The aim of this project is to create one such model.
## Ideation and Planning :
Conversion of potential energy to electricity is possible using different mechanisms :
* Spring-Coil Mechanism    
*	Rack-pinion Mechanism  
* Crank-Shaft Mechanism
* Roller Mechanism
### Spring-Coil Mechanism: 
potential energy &#8594; pneumatic energy &#8594; electrical energy
### Construction of Speed Breaker:
A vibrating type speed breaker should be made such that whenever a vehicle crosses the speed breaker it gets pressed and gets back to original position. The bottom layer is filled with concrete or with wooden plates to provide cushion effect

## Working Principle:
* When a vehicle approaches the speed breaker ,maximum load occurs when the vehicle is on the middle of the speed breaker. When the load is on the speed breaker, the volume of air compressed by it is found by :
* Volume of compressed air = Volume of air in base - Volume of spring= (x m^3)/

* When the pressure in the FRL unit exceeds the defined level the valve opens and the pressurized ail is given to the nozzle.
* The diameter of the inlet of nozzle must be greater than outlet. Here the pressure energy is converted to kinetic energy i.e pressure-high velocity .This high velocity compressed air when hits the impeller ,makes it to rotate.
* Impeller consist of casing and runner buckets .Casing is provided to safeguard device against accidents.
* When the air strikes the runner, it rotates & continues rotation due to inertia.

* Then Alternator-an electrical generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
## Choosing a Pipeline:
Crank-shafts are required to be mounted on bearings which creates balancing problem leading to mechanical vibrations which in turn damage the bearings.<br /> Secondly as bearings are of sliding type, any occurrence of variable load( which is bit obvious in case of vehicles!!) leads to balancing problem.<br />
<br />
Roller mechanism has some different disadvantages
* Maintenance will be very difficult 
* Might cause collision 
So we can use either spring coil mechanism or rack-pinion mechanism 
## Prototyping Phase:
In this phase we actually model the system using either spring coil or rack pinion mechanism .
